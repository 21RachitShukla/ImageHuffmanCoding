# LosslessImageCompression
Huffman coding applied on images to obtain lossless image compression

Project uses matlab library for compressing an image and then reconstructing the original image. *HuffmanImageCoding.m* takes input of an image to be compressed and then compresses the file using huffman coding and gives back the decompressed image.
